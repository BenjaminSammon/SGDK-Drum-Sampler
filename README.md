# SGDK Drum Sampler

## What is SGDK Drum Sampler?

This project allows you to play drum samples on the Sega Megadrive/Genesis using an Everdrive (or as a rom in an emulator). It is pre-loaded with a sample for each button on the player 1 controller but there are instructions on adding your own samples.

To use this project you can either:
    a) go to the folder out > rom.bin and either open in an emulator or copy to an Everdrive
    b) open using SGDK and replace the samples with your own samples and build a new rom
